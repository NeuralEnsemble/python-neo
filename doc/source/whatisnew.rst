  * many test suite improvements
  * Container base class


Version 0.3.3
-------------

  * fix a bug in PlexonIO where some EventArrays only load 1 element.
  * fix a bug in BrainwareSrcIo for segments with no spikes.


Version 0.3.2
-------------

  * cleanup of io test code, with additional helper functions and methods
  * added BrainwareDamIo

  * load_lazy_olbject() in neo.io added
  * added NeuroscopeIO


Version 0.3.0
-------------

  * various bug fixes in neo.io
  * added ElphyIO
  * SpikeTrain performence improved
  * An IO class now can return a list of Block (see read_all_blocks in IOs)

Version 0.2.1
-------------

 * assorted bug fixes
 * added :func:`time_slice()` method to the :class:`SpikeTrain` and :class:`AnalogSignalArray` classes.
 * improvements to annotation data type handling
 * added PickleIO, allowing saving Neo objects in the Python pickle format.

 * improvements to PlexonIO
 * added :func:`merge()` method to the :class:`Block` and :class:`Segment` classes
 * development was mostly moved to GitHub, although the issue tracker is still at neuralensemble.org/neo


Version 0.2.0
-------------

New features compared to neo 0.1:
 * new schema more consistent.
 * new objects: RecordingChannelGroup, EventArray, AnalogSignalArray, EpochArray
 * Neuron is now Unit
 * use the quantities_ module for everything that can have units.
 * Some objects directly inherit from Quantity: SpikeTrain, AnalogSignal, AnalogSignalArray, instead of having an attribute for data.
 * Attributes are classifyed in 3 categories: necessary, recommended, free.
 * lazy and cascade keywords are added to all IOs
 * Python 3 support
 * better tests
