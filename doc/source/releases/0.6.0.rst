=======================
Neo 0.6.0 release notes
=======================

XXth March 2018

This is a draft.

Major changes:
  * Introduced :mod:`neo.rawio`: a low-level reader for various data formats
  * Added continuous integration for all IOs using CircleCI
    (previously only :mod:`neo.core` was tested, using Travis CI)
  * Moved the test file repository to https://web.gin.g-node.org/NeuralEnsemble/ephy_testing_data
    - this makes it easier for people to contribute new files for testing.

Other important changes:
  * Added :func:`time_index()` and :func:`splice()` methods to :class:`AnalogSignal`
  * IO fixes and improvements: Blackrock, TDT, Axon, Spike2, Brainvision, Neuralynx
  * Implemented `__deepcopy__` for all data classes
  * New IO: BCI2000
  * Lots of PEP8 fixes!
  * Implemented `__getitem__` for :class:`Epoch`
  * Removed "cascade" support from all IOs
  * Removed lazy loading except for IOs based on rawio
  * Marked lazy option as deprecated
  * Added :func:`time_slice` in read_segment() for IOs based on rawio
  * Made :attr:`SpikeTrain.times` return a :class:`Quantity` instead of a :class:`SpikeTrain`
  * Raise a :class:`ValueError` if ``t_stop`` is earlier than ``t_start`` when creating an empty :class:`SpikeTrain`
  * Changed filter behaviour to return all objects if no filter parameters are specified
  * Fix pickling/unpickling of :class:`Events`

Deprecated IO classes:
    * :class:`KlustaKwikIO` (use :class:`KwikIO` instead)
    * :class:`PyNNTextIO`, :class:`PyNNNumpyIO`
