=======================
Neo 0.8.0 release notes
=======================

XXth July 2019

Main added features:
  * Proxy object implementation and new lazy mode
  * new neo.utils module
  
Other features:
  * Event and Epoch do not use array_annotations machinery
  * deep copy annotations when slicing
  * numpy 1.16 compatibility
  * time_shift() method for Epoch/Event/AnalogSignal
  * time_slice more robust

New IO classes:
  * Axograph

Many bug fixes and improvements in IO:
  * Blackrock
  * Neuroshare
  * NixIOFr
  * NixIO (array annotation + 1d coordinates)
  * AsciiSignal (fix + json metadata + IrregularlySampledSignals + write proxy)
  * Spike2 (group same sampling rate)
  * Brainvision
  * NeuralynxIO

Warning:
  * Some IOs (base on rawio) when loading can choose to split each 
    channel into separted AnalogSignal or to group then.
    The default behavior (either signal_group_mode='split-all'
    or 'group-same-units') was not the same for all IOs for retro
    compatibility reasons. In next release, all IOs will be 
    signal_group_mode='group-same-units'
  * last release supporting python2.7
