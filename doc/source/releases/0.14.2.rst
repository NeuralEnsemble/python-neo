Code of Conduct 
---------------

As a NumFocus affiliated project, Neo has officially adopted the `NumFocus Code of Conduct`_. Please see `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`_ for 
more information.


CI Changes
----------

We fixed our installation of datalad and git-annex.
We changed our Plexon2 tests to be a cron job as conda-wine-plexon2 behavior was leading to flaky test results.
We hope to track the root of these issues and eventually transition :code:`Plexon2IO` back to main testing.


Bug fixes and improvements in IO modules
----------------------------------------

Bug fixes and/or improvements have been made to :code:`BlackRockIO`, :code:`SpikeGLXIO`, :code:`MaxwellIO`, :code:`NeuralynxIO`, :code:`WinwcprIO`, and :code:`AxonaIO`.
