Neo 0.14.2 release notes
========================

07 July 25

This release of Neo includes many bug fixes in various IOs, continued work on our CI, with an eye to a 1.0 release

See all `pull requests`_ included in this release and the `list of closed issues`_.



CI Changes
---------------

We fixed our installation of datalad and git-annex.
We changed our Plexon2 tests to be a cron job as conda-wine-plexon2 behavior was leading to flaky test results.
We hope to track the root of these issues and eventually transition :code:`Plexon2IO` back to main testing.



Bug fixes and improvements in IO modules
----------------------------------------

Bug fixes and/or improvements have been made to :code:`BlackRockIO`, :code:`SpikeGLXIO`, :code:`MaxwellIO`, :code:`NeuralynxIO`, :code:`WinwcprIO`, and :code:`AxonaIO`.
