Neo is a Python package for working with electrophysiology data in Python, together
with support for reading a wide range of neurophysiology file formats, including
Spike2, NeuroExplorer, AlphaOmega, Axon, Blackrock, Plexon, Tdt, Igor Pro, and support for
writing to a subset of these formats plus non-proprietary formats including Kwik and HDF5.

The goal of Neo is to improve interoperability between Python tools for
analyzing, visualizing and generating electrophysiology data, by providing a common,
shared object model. In order to be as lightweight a dependency as possible,
Neo is deliberately limited to represention of data, with no functions for data
analysis or visualization.

Neo is used by a number of other software tools, including
SpykeViewer_ (data analysis and visualization), Elephant_ (data analysis),
the G-node_ suite (databasing), PyNN_ (simulations), tridesclous_ (spike sorting)
and ephyviewer_ (data visualization).
OpenElectrophy_ (data analysis and visualization) used an older version of Neo.


Neo implements a hierarchical data model well adapted to intracellular and
extracellular electrophysiology and EEG data with support for multi-electrodes
(for example tetrodes). Neo's data objects build on the quantities_ package,
which in turn builds on NumPy by adding support for physical dimensions. Thus
Neo objects behave just like normal NumPy arrays, but with additional metadata,
checks for dimensional consistency and automatic unit conversion.

A project with similar aims but for neuroimaging file formats is `NiBabel`_.
