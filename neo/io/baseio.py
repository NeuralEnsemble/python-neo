class BaseIO:
    """
    Generic class to handle all the file read/write methods for the key objects
    of the core class. This template is file-reading/writing oriented but it
    can also handle data read from/written to a database such as TDT sytem
    tanks or SQLite files.

    This is an abstract class that will be subclassed for each format
    The key methods of the class are:
        - ``read()`` - Read the whole object structure, return a list of Block
                objects
        - ``read_block(lazy=True, **params)`` - Read Block object
                from file with some parameters
        - ``read_segment(lazy=True, **params)`` - Read Segment
                object from file with some parameters
        - ``read_spiketrainlist(lazy=True, **params)`` - Read
                SpikeTrainList object from file with some parameters
        - ``write()`` - Write the whole object structure
        - ``write_block(**params)``    - Write Block object to file with some
                parameters
        - ``write_segment(**params)``    - Write Segment object to file with
                some parameters
        - ``write_spiketrainlist(**params)`` - Write SpikeTrainList object to
                file with some parameters

    The class can also implement these methods:
        - ``read_XXX(lazy=True, **params)``
        - ``write_XXX(**params)``
        where XXX could be one of the objects supported by the IO

    Each class is able to declare what can be accessed or written directly
    discribed by **readable_objects** and **readable_objects**.
    The object types can be one of the classes defined in neo.core
    (Block, Segment, AnalogSignal, ...)

    Each class does not necessary support all the whole neo hierarchy but part
    of it.
    This is described with **supported_objects**.
    All IOs must support at least Block with a read_block()


    ** start a new IO **
    If you want to implement your own file format, you should create a class
    that will inherit from this BaseFile class and implement the previous
    methods.
