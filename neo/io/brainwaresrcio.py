Class for reading from Brainware SRC files

SRC files are binary files for holding spike data.  They are broken up into
nested data sequences of different types, with each type of sequence identified
by a unique ID number.  This allows new versions of sequences to be included
without breaking backwards compatibility, since new versions can just be given
a new ID number.

The ID numbers and the format of the data they contain were taken from the
Matlab-based reader function supplied with BrainWare.  The python code,
however, was implemented from scratch in Python using Python idioms.

There are some situations where BrainWare data can overflow the SRC file,
resulting in a corrupt file.  Neither BrainWare nor the Matlab-based
reader can read such files.  This software, however, will try to recover
the data, and in most cases can do so successfully.

Each SRC file can hold the equivalent of multiple Neo Blocks.

Brainware was developed by Dr. Jan Schnupp and is availabe from
Tucker Davis Technologies, Inc.

Neither Dr. Jan Schnupp nor Tucker Davis Technologies, Inc. had any part in the
development of this code

    '''
    Class for reading Brainware Spike ReCord files with the extension '.src'

    The read_block method returns the first Block of the file.  It will
    automatically close the file after reading.
    The read method is the same as read_block.

    The read_all_blocks method automatically reads all Blocks.  It will
    automatically close the file after reading.

    The read_next_block method will return one Block each time it is called.
    It will automatically close the file and reset to the first Block
    after reading the last block.
    Call the close method to close the file and reset this method
    back to the first Block.

    The isopen property tells whether the file is currently open and
    reading or closed.

    Note 1:
        The first Unit in each RecordingChannelGroup is always
        UnassignedSpikes, which has a SpikeTrain for each Segment containing
        all the spikes not assigned to any Unit in that Segment.

    Note 2:
        The first Segment in each Block is always Comments, which stores all
        comments as Event objects.  The Event times are the timestamps
        of the comments as the number of days since dec 30th 1899, while the
        timestamp attribute has the same value in python datetime format

    Note 3:
        The parameters from the BrainWare table for each condition are stored
        in the Segment annotations.  If there are multiple repetitions of
        a condition, each repetition is stored as a separate Segment.

    Note 4:
        There is always only one RecordingChannelGroup.  BrainWare stores the
        equivalent of RecordingChannelGroups in separate files.

    Usage:
        >>> from neo.io.brainwaresrcio import BrainwareSrcIO
        >>> srcfile = BrainwareSrcIO(filename='multi_500ms_mulitrep_ch1.src')
        >>> blk1 = srcfile.read()
        >>> blk2 = srcfile.read_block()
        >>> blks = srcfile.read_all_blocks()
        >>> print blk1.segments
        >>> print blk1.segments[0].spiketrains
        >>> print blk1.units
        >>> print blk1.units[0].name
        >>> print blk2
        >>> print blk2[0].segments
        >>> print blks
        >>> print blks[0].segments
