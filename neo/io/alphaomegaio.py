Class for reading data from Alpha Omega .map files.

This class is an experimental reader with important limitations.
See the source code for details of the limitations.
The code of this reader is of alpha quality and received very limited testing.

This code is written from the incomplete file specifications available in:

Edited by ALPHA OMEGA Home Office: P.O. Box 810, Nazareth Illit 17105, Israel

and from the source code of a C software for conversion of .map files to
.eeg elan software files :

# NOTE: For some specific types of comments, the following convention is used:
# "TODO:" Desirable future evolution
# "WARNING:" Information about code that is based on broken or missing
# specifications and that might be wrong


# Main limitations of this reader:
# - The reader is only able to load data stored in data blocks of type 5
#   (data block for one channel). In particular it means that it doesn't
#   support signals stored in blocks of type 7 (data block for multiple
#   channels).
#   For more details on these data blocks types, see 5.4.1 and 5.4.2 p 127 in
#   [1].
# - Rather than supporting all the neo objects types that could be extracted
#   from the file, all read data are returned in AnalogSignal objects, even for
#   digital channels or channels containing spiking informations.
# - Digital channels are not converted to events or events array as they
#   should.
# - Loading multichannel signals as AnalogSignalArrays is not supported.
# - Many data or metadata that are avalaible in the file and that could be
#   represented in some way in the neo model are not extracted. In particular
#   scaling of the data and extraction of the units of the signals are not
#   supported.
# - It received very limited testing, exlusively using python 2.6.6. In
#   particular it has not been tested using Python 3.x.
#
# These limitations are mainly due to the following reasons:
# - Incomplete, unclear and in some places innacurate specifications of the
#   format in [1].
# - Lack of test files containing all the types of data blocks of interest
#   (in particular no file with type 7 data block for multiple channels where
#   available when writing this code).
# - Lack of knowledge of the Alphamap software and the associated data models.
# - Lack of time (especially as the specifications are incomplete, a lot of
#   reverse engineering and testing is required, which makes the development of
#   this IO very painful and long).
