        ----------
        dirname : str
            Directory containing data files
        filename : str
            Deprecated and will be removed. Please use `include_filenames` instead
            Name of a single ncs, nse, nev, or ntt file to include in dataset. Will be ignored,
            if dirname is provided.
        use_cache : bool, optional
            Cache results of initial file scans for faster loading in subsequent runs.
            Default: False
        cache_path : str, optional
            Folder path to use for cache files.
            Default: 'same_as_resource'
        exclude_filename: None,
            Deprecated and will be removed. Please use `exclude_filenames` instead
        include_filenames: str or list
            Filename or list of filenames to be included. This can be absolute path or path relative to dirname.
        exclude_filenames: str or list
            Filename or list of filenames to be excluded. Expects base filenames without
            directory path.
        keep_original_times : bool
            Preserve original time stamps as in data files. By default datasets are
            shifted to begin at t_start = 0*pq.second.
