The Feature File

Generic file name: base.fet.n

Format: ASCII, integer values

The feature file lists for each spike the PCA coefficients for each
electrode, followed by the timestamp of the spike (more features can
be inserted between the PCA coefficients and the timestamp).
The first line contains the number of dimensions.
Assuming N1 spikes (spike1...spikeN1), N2 electrodes (e1...eN2) and
N3 coefficients (c1...cN3), this file looks like:

nbDimensions
c1_e1_spk1   c2_e1_spk1  ... cN3_e1_spk1   c1_e2_spk1  ... cN3_eN2_spk1   timestamp_spk1
c1_e1_spk2   c2_e1_spk2  ... cN3_e1_spk2   c1_e2_spk2  ... cN3_eN2_spk2   timestamp_spk2
...
c1_e1_spkN1  c2_e1_spkN1 ... cN3_e1_spkN1  c1_e2_spkN1 ... cN3_eN2_spkN1  timestamp_spkN1

The timestamp is expressed in multiples of the sampling interval. For
instance, for a 20kHz recording (50 microsecond sampling interval), a
timestamp of 200 corresponds to 200x0.000050s=0.01s from the beginning
of the recording session.

Notice that the last line must end with a newline or carriage return.
