'''
This module implements :class:`BaseSignal`, an array of signals.
This is a parent class from which all signal objects inherit:
    :class:`AnalogSignal` and :class:`IrregularlySampledSignal`

:class:`BaseSignal` inherits from :class:`quantities.Quantity`, which
inherits from :class:`numpy.array`.
Inheritance from :class:`numpy.array` is explained here:
http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.subclassing.html

In brief:
* Constructor :meth:`__new__` for :class:`BaseSignal` doesn't exist.
Only child objects :class:`AnalogSignal` and :class:`IrregularlySampledSignal`
can be created.
