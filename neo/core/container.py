class Container(BaseNeo):

    This is the base class from which Neo container objects inherit.  It
    derives from :class:`BaseNeo`.

    In addition to the setup :class:`BaseNeo` does, this class also
    automatically sets up the lists to hold the children of the object.

    Each class can define one or more of the following class attributes
    (in  addition to those of BaseNeo):
        :_container_child_objects: Neo container objects that can be children
                                   of this object. This attribute is used in
                                   cases where the child can only have one
                                   parent of this type. An instance attribute
                                   named class.__name__.lower()+'s' will be
                                   automatically defined to hold this child and
                                   will be initialized to an empty list.
        :_data_child_objects: Neo data objects that can be children
                              of this object. An instance attribute named
                              class.__name__.lower()+'s' will be automatically
                              defined to hold this child and will be
                              initialized to an empty list.
        :_multi_child_objects: Neo container objects that can be children
                               of this object. This attribute is used in
                               cases where the child can have multiple
                               parents of this type. An instance attribute

                               will be initialized to an empty list.
        :_child_properties: Properties that return sub-children of a particular
                            type.  These properties must still be defined.
                            This is mostly used for generate_diagram.
        :_repr_pretty_containers: The names of containers attributes printed
                                  when pretty-printing using iPython.

    The following helper properties are available
    (in  addition to those of BaseNeo):
        :_single_child_objects: All neo container objects that can be children
                                of this object and where the child can only
                                have one parent of this type.

                           this type.

                          where the child can have multiple parents of

        :container_children: All container objects that are children of
                             the current object.
        :children: All Neo objects that are children of the current object.
        :data_children_recur: All data objects that are children of
                              the current object or any of its children,
                              any of its children's children, etc.
        :container_children_recur: All container objects that are children of
                                   the current object or any of its children,
                                   any of its children's children, etc.

                         any of its children's children, etc.

    The following "universal" methods are available
    (in  addition to those of BaseNeo):
        :size: A dictionary where each key is an attribute storing child
               objects and the value is the number of objects stored in that
               attribute.

        :filter(**args): Retrieves children of the current object that
                         have particular properties.

        :list_children_by_class(**args): Retrieves all children of the current
                                         object recursively that are of a
                                         particular class.

        :create_many_to_one_relationship(**args): For each child of the current
                                                  object that can only have a
                                                  single parent, set its parent
                                                  to be the current object.

        :create_many_to_many_relationship(**args): For children of the current
                                                   object that can have more
                                                   than one parent of this
                                                   type, put the current
                                                   object in the parent list.

        :create_relationship(**args): Combines
                                      :create_many_to_one_relationship: and
                                      :create_many_to_many_relationship:

        :merge(**args): Annotations are merged based on the rules of
                        :merge_annotations:.  Child objects with the same name
                        and a :merge: method are merged using that method.
                        Other child objects are appended to the relevant
                        container attribute.  Parents attributes are NOT
                        changed in this operation.
                        Unlike :BaseNeo.merge:, this method implements
                        all necessary merge rules for a container class.
