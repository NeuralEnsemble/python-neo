"""
ExampleRawIO is a class of a  fake example.
This is to be used when coding a new RawIO.


Rules for creating a new class:
  1. Step 1: Create the main class
    * Create a file in **neo/rawio/** that endith with "rawio.py"
    * Create the class that inherits from BaseRawIO
    * copy/paste all methods that need to be implemented.
    * code hard! The main difficulty is `_parse_header()`.
      In short you have to create a mandatory dict that
      contains channel informations::

            self.header = {}
            self.header['nb_block'] = 2
            self.header['nb_segment'] = [2, 3]
            self.header['signal_streams'] = signal_streams
            self.header['signal_channels'] = signal_channels
            self.header['spike_channels'] = spike_channels
            self.header['event_channels'] = event_channels

  2. Step 2: RawIO test:
    * create a file in neo/rawio/tests with the same name with "test_" prefix
    * copy paste neo/rawio/tests/test_examplerawio.py and do the same

  3. Step 3 : Create the neo.io class with the wrapper
    * Create a file in neo/io/ that ends with "io.py"
    * Create a class that inherits both your RawIO class and BaseFromRaw class
    * copy/paste from neo/io/exampleio.py

  4.Step 4 : IO test
    * create a file in neo/test/iotest with the same previous name with "test_" prefix
    * copy/paste from neo/test/iotest/test_exampleio.py

    Class for "reading" fake data from an imaginary file.

    For the user, it gives access to raw data (signals, event, spikes) as they
    are in the (fake) file int16 and int64.

    For a developer, it is just an example showing guidelines for someone who wants
    to develop a new IO module.

    Two rules for developers:
      * Respect the :ref:`neo_rawio_API`
      * Follow the :ref:`io_guiline`

    This fake IO:
        * has 2 blocks
        * blocks have 2 and 3 segments
        * has  2 signals streams  of 8 channel each (sample_rate = 10000) so 16 channels in total
        * has 3 spike_channels
        * has 2 event channels: one has *type=event*, the other has
          *type=epoch*


    Usage:
        >>> import neo.rawio
        >>> r = neo.rawio.ExampleRawIO(filename='itisafake.nof')
        >>> r.parse_header()
        >>> print(r)
        >>> raw_chunk = r.get_analogsignal_chunk(block_index=0, seg_index=0,
                            i_start=0, i_stop=1024,  channel_names=channel_names)
        >>> float_chunk = reader.rescale_signal_raw_to_float(raw_chunk, dtype='float64',
                            channel_indexes=[0, 3, 6])
        >>> spike_timestamp = reader.spike_timestamps(spike_channel_index=0,
                            t_start=None, t_stop=None)
        >>> spike_times = reader.rescale_spike_timestamp(spike_timestamp, 'float64')
