ExampleRawIO is a class of a  fake example.
This is to be used when coding a new RawIO.


Rules for creating a new class:
  1. Step 1: Create the main class
    * Create a file in **neo/rawio/** that endith with "rawio.py"
    * Create the class that inherits BaseRawIO
    * copy/paste all methods that need to be implemented.
      See the end a neo.rawio.baserawio.BaseRawIO
    * code hard! The main difficulty **is _parse_header()**.
      In short you have a create a mandatory dict than
      contains channel informations::

            self.header = {}
            self.header['nb_block'] = 2
            self.header['nb_segment'] = [2, 3]
            self.header['signal_channels'] = sig_channels
            self.header['unit_channels'] = unit_channels
            self.header['event_channels'] = event_channels

  2. Step 2: RawIO test:
    * create a file in neo/rawio/tests with the same name with "test_" prefix
    * copy paste neo/rawio/tests/test_examplerawio.py and do the same

  3. Step 3 : Create the neo.io class with the wrapper
    * Create a file in neo/io/ that endith with "io.py"
    * Create a that inherits both your RawIO class and BaseFromRaw class
    * copy/paste from neo/io/exampleio.py

  4.Step 4 : IO test
    * create a file in neo/test/iotest with the same previous name with "test_" prefix
    * copy/paste from neo/test/iotest/test_exampleio.py

    Class for reading raw data from the Axona dacqUSB system:
    http://space-memory-navigation.org/DacqUSBFileFormats.pdf

    The raw data is save in .bin binary files. 

    For the user, it give acces to raw data (signals, event, spikes) as they
    are in the (fake) file int16 and int64.

    For a developer, it is just an example showing guidelines for someone who wants
    to develop a new IO module.

    Two rules for developers:
      * Respect the :ref:`neo_rawio_API`
      * Follow the :ref:`io_guiline`

    This fake IO:
        * have 2 blocks
        * blocks have 2 and 3 segments
        * have 16 signal_channel sample_rate = 10000
        * have 3 unit_channel
        * have 2 event channel: one have *type=event*, the other have
          *type=epoch*
