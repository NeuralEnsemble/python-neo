Rules for creating a new class:
  1. Step 1: Create the main class
    * Create a file in **neo/rawio/** that endith with "rawio.py"
    * Create the class that inherits from BaseRawIO
    * copy/paste all methods that need to be implemented.
    * code hard! The main difficulty is `_parse_header()`.
      In short you have a create a mandatory dict than
      contains channel informations::

            self.header = {}
            self.header['nb_block'] = 2
            self.header['nb_segment'] = [2, 3]
            self.header['signal_streams'] = signal_streams
            self.header['signal_channels'] = signal_channels
            self.header['spike_channels'] = spike_channels
            self.header['event_channels'] = event_channels

  2. Step 2: RawIO test:
    * create a file in neo/rawio/tests with the same name with "test_" prefix
    * copy paste neo/rawio/tests/test_examplerawio.py and do the same

  3. Step 3 : Create the neo.io class with the wrapper
    * Create a file in neo/io/ that ends with "io.py"
    * Create a class that inherits both your RawIO class and BaseFromRaw class
    * copy/paste from neo/io/exampleio.py

  4.Step 4 : IO test
    * create a file in neo/test/iotest with the same previous name with "test_" prefix
    * copy/paste from neo/test/iotest/test_exampleio.py
